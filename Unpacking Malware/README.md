<h1>Introduction</h1>
Modern malware typically employs a variety of defense evasion techniques, including packing. As malware unpacks additional code, it needs to inject it somewhere in order to execute. There are a variety of ways to do this, but the most common are DLL Injection, PE Injection, and Process Hollowing. These techniques are all explained in further detail later in the post. While these techniques can hinder the analysis process, they can be easily defeated using a debugger such as <a href="https://x64dbg.com/#start" target="_new">x64dbg</a>.
